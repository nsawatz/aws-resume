# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

Since deciding to pursue a career in cloud computing, I have been eager to build a cloud-based project. I first came across this project through a YouTube channel and have planned to complete it from the start. The channel introduced me to The [The Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) by Forrest Brazeal. After exploring the website, I knew it was the perfect challenge for me. This hands-on project integrates essential cloud skills and services, providing a deeper understanding of the development process.
