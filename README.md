# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

Since deciding to pursue a career in cloud computing, I have been eager to build a cloud-based project. I first came across this project through a YouTube channel and have planned to complete it from the start. The channel introduced me to The [The Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) by Forrest Brazeal. After exploring the website, I knew it was the perfect challenge for me. This hands-on project integrates essential cloud skills and services, providing a deeper understanding of the development process.

## Setting up the frontend website

First, you need to set up a website using HTML and CSS. I chose a simple template from Start Bootstrap and customized it with my personal details. Since the goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with AWS services rather than web development, using an easy-to-work-with template was ideal. Having some prior experience with HTML and CSS, this also served as a great refresher.

Next, I uploaded my files to an AWS S3 bucket for storage and website hosting. Since I didnâ€™t have a domain name, I registered nicklaus-sawatzke.com through Route 53. I then used AWS Certificate Manager to store and verify an SSL/TLS certificate for HTTPS.

To ensure fast and efficient content delivery, I created an AWS CloudFront distribution (CDN) to cache and serve my resume website from Edge locations, minimizing latency. Afterward, I mapped my domain name to the CloudFront distribution by creating a CNAME record in Route 53.
